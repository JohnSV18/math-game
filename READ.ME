#Mathris
My name is John Saguay and this is Mathris. The purpose of this game is to catch the balls falling from above and accumlating points
as you catch them. Now, you only have 10 lives. So if you let 10 or more balls fall past your cart then you will lose. To win the game you will need
to catch the balls and have the same amount as the target score. If you lose your 10 lives before you reach the target score, then you lose.
I hope you all enjoy, and GOOD LUCK!
